## Lyrics

```

nothing's forever you know memories become dissolved
stiff in grey, it ain't the folds
i'm still predicting the unknown too sudden clinging to control
- what i do is unfold through a treason of thought 

dormant in motion
attention seeking 
for misery you still keeping 
thrilled you might be thinking 
that i'm seeking redemption 
applause for doing the wrong
it sure is a hell of a trick 
of a question when you're 
always applying the doubts

tied to a tree on a shore of endless rocks

i don't see further than the vastness of all

I don't blame the eyesight for the mind

called for a reason so blatanat that has been gone since the very moment it was told

dormant in motion
seeking attention  for misery you keep thinking that i'm
redemption seeking 
applauded for doing the wrong

tied to a tree on a shore of endless rocks

called for a reason so blatanat that has been gone since the very moment it was told

numb till i see your eyes in the shroud
feeling all there is to see too much too frown upon with no purpose no reason for existence you come undone

become undone once then twice and do it again if you feel like darkness has become your only friend

```
